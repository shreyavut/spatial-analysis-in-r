# Spatial Analysis in R - NICAR 2024
### Shreya Vuttaluru, Tampa Bay Times, and Ryan Little, The Baltimore Banner

This GitHub repository accompanies a class on spatial analysis in R. We'll cover basic spatial functions for transforming data and explore tools for exploratory mapping, spatial joins, buffering, calculating spatial distances between points and spatial indexing.

We'll be using the `sf` package for geospatial functions. This package has many of the same functions available in geospatial software like ArcGIS, QGIS and PostGIS. 

Some advantages of using `sf` for spatial analysis: 

* Easy to integrate with other data analysis and cleaning steps 
* Reproduce your scripts
* Fairly easy visualization
* Faster processing time for large datasets
* Free! ðŸ’°
