Working with data based off of images can be confusing! 

We'll be using the`raster` and `terra` and package for extracting information from our files, and `sf` fore more traditional spatial joins. 

### Step 1: Load required packages.

```{r}

### This code will install the packages required for this project if you don't already have them installed.
packages <- c("sf", "tidyverse", "raster", "mapview", "janitor", "lubridate", "tidycensus", "terra")

for (pkg in packages) {
  if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg)
  }
}

### Import our packages into our script here.
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)
library(raster)
library(lubridate)
library(tidycensus)

```

### Step 2: Load in the data sets we'll be working with
